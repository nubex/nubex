- 👋 Hi, I’m @nubex
- 👀 I’m interested in music, movies, video games, pop culture in general, and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, C#, C++, and any other language or resource that will help me create my own games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. When I get to the point of starting to make my first game I'll need help with graphic design and music for the game and am always willing to take feedback or help on trying to make an innovative game.
- 📫 How to reach me: If you're interested in collaberation and are new to programming, video game design/creation, or just new to your speciality within video game design/creation, then you'll almost be on par with where I am. But who says that if you get a bunch of newbs together, provided everyone is driven, that we can't collaborate and create an amazing game!
